# About Simple Text Control
A simple yet flexible PCF control to display text with custom style on a Unified Interface Form on CDS.

Text could be displayed with custom formats. to get user's attention. The control allows customizer to add longer text than out of the box label control or section label. A maximum of about #800# characters in total can be added. The number 800 includes any HTML tags added to the text. PCF configuration page only allows 160 characters. To get around that limit, this control has 5 text input properties (Text  Part 1-5), allowing you to add about 800 characters.
